# AISAC README

## What is AISAC?
AISAC is a project which I am undertaking to create an application that assists The Division 2 Agents (agents) with creating builds and understanding the stats in the game. I've been playing the game for several years now, not including the time spent in The Division 1. The game does a great job of emulating real life cities post apocalypse while hitting the MMO/Co-op itch. What AISAC aims to solve is simplifying the stats and builds in the game so everyone can understand the stats and build out loadouts to their liking.

## How it works (How I plan it to work)
Unfortunately at time of creation of the project, Ubisoft does not provide an API for access of in game items. There have been several attempts by awesome individuals to create databases of the items, however due to the lack of API, these databases are not maintained when new items are added to the game or simply inaccurate.

Data flow will look something like this:
